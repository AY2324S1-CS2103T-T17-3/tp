### Project: Tutor Connect

This is an address book made for tuition centre managers to easily track, schedule, 
and notify tutors of their upcoming schedule, optimised for users who prefer a CLI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: 
  * [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jweng88&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * **New feature:** Added the ability to mark schedules. 
  (Pull request [#144](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/144))
    * What it does: Allows the user to mark a specified schedule as MISSED or COMPLETED.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to create and set the status of a specified
    schedule.
  * **New feature:** Added the ability to view both tutor list and schedule list in one panel. 
  (Pull request [#212](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/212))
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the tutor list and schedule list side by side within the main panel.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to easily refer to the tutor list or 
    schedule list when inputting commands like `edit-t` or `edit-s` that requires referring to the index in the list.
  * **Refactored feature:** Refactored the `ListCommand` to `ListTutorCommand`. 
  (Pull request [#86](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/86))
    * What it does: Updates the existing list command with the context of the application, tutors.
  * **Refactored feature:** Refactored the `DeleteCommand` to `DeleteTutorCommand`.
    (Pull request [#87](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/87))
